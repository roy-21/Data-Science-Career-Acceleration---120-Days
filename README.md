# Data Science Career Acceleration

### From Python Foundations to Job-Ready Data Scientist

Hi!  
Welcome to my **Data Science journey**, where I’m building real, industry-aligned skills to become a **job-ready Data Scientist**.

This repository is my:
-  Daily learning & practice log  
-  Data science experimentation space  
-  Knowledge base (concepts + notes)  
-  Growing professional portfolio  

---

##  Purpose of This Repository

Over the next **120 days**, my goal is to:

- Build a **strong Python foundation** for data analysis  
- Master **data handling, cleaning, and visualization**
- Develop practical **machine learning workflows**
- Work on **real-world, end-to-end data science projects**
- Prepare for **data science interviews and job roles**

This repo documents everything — learning, mistakes, improvements, and results.
