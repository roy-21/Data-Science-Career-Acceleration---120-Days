#  Month 01 — Python Foundations for Data Science

This folder contains **everything I learn and practice in Month 01** of the  
**Data Science Career Acceleration (120 Days)** program.

Month 01 is focused on building a **strong Python foundation**, which is critical
for data analysis, machine learning, and real-world problem solving.

---

##  Objectives of Month 01

By the end of this month, I aim to:

- Gain strong confidence in **core Python programming**
- Develop **logical thinking** and problem-solving skills
- Understand and apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Write **clean, readable, and well-structured Python code**
- Build habits used by professional data scientists

---

##  Topics Covered

###  Python Fundamentals
- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Input/output handling

### Functions & Modularity
- Function definitions
- Arguments & return values
- Scope and best practices

###  Data Structures
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Iteration and manipulation techniques

###  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

###  Python Internals & Best Practices
- Truthy vs Falsy values
- Floating-point precision issues
- Ternary expressions
- Memory concepts (heap, garbage collection)
- Writing professional `.py` scripts

---

##  Practice & Exercises

- Daily coding challenges
- Micro-challenges to build deep understanding
- Logic-based problem solving
- Code refactoring and improvement

> Practice files may include intentionally simple examples to reinforce core concepts.

## Development Guidelines

- Primary development is done using **`.py` files**
- Jupyter Notebooks are used only when visualization or exploration is needed
- Code quality matters: naming, structure, functions, documentation
- Regular commits with meaningful messages

---

##  Why Month 01 Matters

A strong foundation in Python determines how effective I’ll be in:
- Data cleaning & analysis
- Machine learning pipelines
- Writing scalable, maintainable code

This month sets the **base for the entire 120-day journey**.
